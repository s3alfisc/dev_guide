If your package deals with one or more commercial services, please make sure the name does not violate branding guidelines. You can check if your package name is available, informative and not offensive by using the available package. In particular, do not choose a package name that’s already used on CRAN or Bioconductor.\nA more unique package name might be easier to track (for you and us to assess package use) and search (for users to find it and to google their questions). Obviously a too unique package name might make the package less discoverable (e.g. it might be an argument for naming your package geojson).\nFind other interesting aspects of naming your package in this blog post by Nick Tierney, and in case you change your mind, find out how to rename your package in this other blog post of Nick’s.\n\n1.1.2 Creating metadata for your package\nWe recommend you to use the codemetar package for creating and updating a JSON CodeMeta metadata file for your package via codemetar::write_codemeta(). It will automatically include all useful information, including GitHub topics. CodeMeta uses Schema.org terms so as it gains popularity the JSON metadata of your package might be used by third-party services, maybe even search engines."

    "text": "1.3 Package API\n\n1.3.1 Function and argument naming\n\n\nFunctions and arguments naming should be chosen to work together to form a common, logical programming API that is easy to read, and auto-complete.\n\nConsider an object_verb() naming scheme for functions in your package that take a common data type or interact with a common API. object refers to the data/API and verb the primary action. This scheme helps avoid namespace conflicts with packages that may have similar verbs, and makes code readable and easy to auto-complete. For instance, in stringi, functions starting with stri_ manipulate strings (stri_join(), stri_sort(), and in googlesheets functions starting with gs_ are calls to the Google Sheets API (gs_auth(), gs_user(), gs_download()).\n\n\nFor functions that manipulate an object/data and return an object/data of the same type, make the object/data the first argument of the function so as to enhance compatibility with the pipe operator (%>%).\nWe strongly recommend snake_case over all other styles unless you are porting over a package that is already in wide use.\nAvoid function name conflicts with base packages or other popular ones (e.g. ggplot2, dplyr, magrittr, data.table)\nArgument naming and order should be consistent across functions that use similar inputs.\nPackage functions importing data should not import data to the global environment, but instead must return objects. Assignments to the global environment are to be avoided in general.\n\n1.3.2 Console messages\n\nUse message() and warning() to communicate with the user in your functions. Please do not use print() or cat() unless it’s for a print.*() or str.*() methods, as these methods of printing messages are harder for the user to suppress.\n\n1.3.3 Interactive/Graphical Interfaces\nIf providing graphical user interface (GUI) (such as a Shiny app), to facilitate workflow, include a mechanism to automatically reproduce steps taken in the GUI. This could include auto-generation of code to reproduce the same outcomes, output of intermediate values produced in the interactive tool, or simply clear and well-documented mapping between GUI actions and scripted functions. (See also “Testing” below.)\nThe tabulizer package e.g. has an interactive workflow to extract tables, but can also only extract coordinates so one can re-run things as a script. Besides, two examples of shiny apps that do code generation are https://gdancik.shinyapps.io/shinyGEO/, and https://github.com/wallaceEcoMod/wallace/."

We recommend the styler package for automating part of the code styling. We suggest reading the Tidyverse style guide.\nYou can choose to use = over <- as long you are consistent with one choice within your package. We recommend avoiding the use of -> for assignment within a package. If you do use <- throughout your package, and you also use R6 in that package, you’ll be forced to use = for assignment within your R6Class construction - this is not considered an inconsistency because you can’t use <- in this case."

    "section": "\n1.6 README",
    "text": "1.6 README\n\n\nAll packages should have a README file, named README.md, in the root of the repository. The README should include, from top to bottom:\n\nThe package name.\nBadges for continuous integration and test coverage, the badge for rOpenSci peer-review once it has started (see below), a repostatus.org badge, and any other badges (e.g. R-universe). If the README has many more badges, you might want to consider using a table for badges, see this example, that one and that one. Such a table should be more wide than high.\nShort description of goals of package, with descriptive links to all vignettes (rendered, i.e. readable, cf the documentation website section) unless the package is small and there’s only one vignette repeating the README.\nInstallation instructions using e.g. the remotes package, pak package, or R-universe.\nAny additional setup required (authentication tokens, etc).\nBrief demonstration usage.\nIf applicable, how the package compares to other similar packages and/or how it relates to other packages.\nCitation information i.e. Direct users to the preferred citation in the README by adding boilerplate text “here’s how to cite my package”. See e.g. ecmwfr README.\n\n\n\nIf you use another repo status badge such as a lifecycle badge, please also add a repostatus.org badge. Example of a repo README with two repo status badges.\n\nOnce you have submitted a package and it has passed editor checks, add a peer-review badge via\n\n[![](https://badges.ropensci.org/<issue_id>_status.svg)](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/<issue_id>)\nwhere issue_id is the number of the issue in the software-review repository. For instance, the badge for rtimicropem review uses the number 126 since it’s the review issue number. The badge will first indicated “under review” and then “peer-reviewed” once your package has been onboarded (issue labelled “approved” and closed), and will link to the review issue.\n\n\nIf your README has many badges consider ordering them in an html table to make it easier for newcomers to gather information at a glance. See examples in drake repo and in qualtRics repo. Possible sections are\n\nDevelopment (CI statuses cf CI chapter, Slack channel for discussion, repostatus)\nRelease/Published (CRAN version and release date badges from METACRAN, CRAN checks API badge, Zenodo badge)\nStats/Usage (downloads e.g. download badges from METACRAN) The table should be more wide than it is long in order to mask the rest of the README.\n\n\nIf your package connects to a data source or online service, or wraps other software, consider that your package README may be the first point of entry for users. It should provide enough information for users to understand the nature of the data, service, or software, and provide links to other relevant data and documentation. For instance, a README should not merely read, “Provides access to GooberDB,” but also include, “…, an online repository of Goober sightings in South America. More information about GooberDB, and documentation of database structure and metadata can be found at link”.\nWe recommend not creating README.md directly, but from a README.Rmd file (an R Markdown file) if you have any demonstration code. The advantage of the .Rmd file is you can combine text with code that can be easily updated whenever your package is updated.\nConsider using usethis::use_readme_rmd() to get a template for a README.Rmd file and to automatically set up a pre-commit hook to ensure that README.md is always newer than README.Rmd.\nExtensive examples should be kept for a vignette. If you want to make the vignettes more accessible before installing the package, we suggest creating a website for your package.\nAdd a code of conduct and contribution guidelines.\nSee the gistr README for a good example README to follow for a small package, and bowerbird README for a good example README for a larger package."

    "section": "\n1.7 Documentation",
    "text": "1.7 Documentation\n\n1.7.1 General\n\nAll exported package functions should be fully documented with examples.\nIf there is potential overlap or confusion with other packages providing similar functionality or having a similar name, add a note in the README, main vignette and potentially the Description field of DESCRIPTION. Example in rtweet README, rebird README.\nThe package should contain top-level documentation for ?foobar, (or ?`foobar-package` if there is a naming conflict). Optionally, you can use both ?foobar and ?`foobar-package` for the package level manual file, using @aliases roxygen tag. usethis::use_package_doc() adds the template for the top-level documentation.\nThe package should contain at least one HTML vignette providing a substantial coverage of package functions, illustrating realistic use cases and how functions are intended to interact. If the package is small, the vignette and the README may have very similar content.\nAs is the case for a README, top-level documentation or vignettes may be the first point of entry for users. If your package connects to a data source or online service, or wraps other software, it should provide enough information for users to understand the nature of the data, service, or software, and provide links to other relevant data and documentation. For instance, a vignette intro or documentation should not merely read, “Provides access to GooberDB,” but also include, “…, an online repository of Goober sightings in South America. More information about GooberDB, and documentation of database structure and metadata can be found at link”. Any vignette should outline prerequisite knowledge to be able to understand the vignette upfront.\n\nThe general vignette should present a series of examples progressing in complexity from basic to advanced usage.\n\nFunctionality likely to be used by only more advanced users or developers might be better put in a separate vignette (e.g. programming/NSE with dplyr).\nThe README, the top-level package docs, vignettes, websites, etc., should all have enough information at the beginning to get a high-level overview of the package and the services/data it connects to, and provide navigation to other relevant pieces of documentation. This is to follow the principle of multiple points of entry i.e. to take into account the fact that any piece of documentation may be the first encounter the user has with the package and/or the tool/data it wraps.\nThe vignette(s) should include citations to software and papers where appropriate.\nIf your package provides access to a data source, we require that DESCRIPTION contains both (1) A brief identification and/or description of the organisation responsible for issuing data; and (2) The URL linking to public-facing page providing, describing, or enabling data access (which may often differ from URL leading directly to data source).\nOnly use package startup messages when necessary (function masking for instance). Avoid package startup messages like “This is foobar 2.4-0” or citation guidance because they can be annoying to the user. Rely on documentation for such guidance.\nYou can choose to have a README section about use cases of your package (other packages, blog posts, etc.), example.\n\n1.7.2 roxygen2 use\n\nWe request all submissions to use roxygen2 for documentation. roxygen2 is an R package that automatically compiles .Rd files to your man folder in your package from simple tags written above each function.\nMore information on using roxygen2 documentation is available in the R packages book.\nIf you were writing Rd by hand, the Rd2roxygen package contains functions to convert Rd to roxygen documentation.\nOne key advantage of using roxygen2 is that your NAMESPACE will always be automatically generated and up to date.\nAll functions should document the type of object returned under the @return heading.\nDocumentation should support user navigation by including useful cross-links between related functions and documenting related functions together in groups or in common help pages. The @seealso and @family tags (the latter of which automatically creates “See also” links and can help group functions together on pkgdown sites), are recommended for this purpose. See the “manual” section of The R Packages book and the “function grouping” section of the present chapter for more details.\nYou could re-use documentation pieces (e.g. details about authentication, related packages) across the vignettes/README/man pages. A possible approach for that is the use of R Markdown fragments, relying on knitr use of child documents so you can store the re-used parts in a folder in man/, and call them from both the README and the vignette as well as in man pages by using the @includeRmd tag available from roxygen 0.7.0.\nAdd #' @noRd to internal functions.\n\nIf you prefer not to clutter up code with extensive documentation, you can place further examples outside of the R script and use the @example tag; and you place further documentation in files in a man-roxygen folder in the root of your package, and those will be combined into the manual file by the use of @template <file name>, for example.\n\nPut any documentation for an object in a .R file in the man-roxygen folder (at the root of your package). For example, this file. Link to that template file from your function (e.g.) with the @template keyword (e.g.). The contents of the template will be inserted when documentation is built into the resulting .Rd file that users will see when they ask for documentation for the function.\nNote that if you are using markdown documentation, markdown currently doesn’t work in template files, so make sure to use latex formatting.\nIn most cases you can ignore templates and man-roxygen, but there are two cases in which leveraging them will greatly help:\n\nWhen you have a lot of documentation for a function/class/object separating out certain chunks of that documentation can keep your .R source file tidy. This is especially useful when you have a lot of code in that .R file. On the other hand, it means the docs are not readable “in-source” since they’re in another file.\nWhen you have the same documentation parts used across many .R functions it’s helpful to use a template. This reduces duplicated text, and helps prevent mistakenly updating documentation for one function but not the other. Using a template file for a parameter documentation is an alternative to defining the parameter for one function and using @inheritParams for other functions using the same parameter.\n\n\n\n\nStarting from roxygen2 version 7.0.0, R6 classes are officially supported. See the roxygen2 docs for details on how to document R6 classes.\n\n1.7.3 URLs in documentation\nThis subsection is particularly relevant to authors wishing to submit their package to CRAN. CRAN will check URLs in your documentation and does not allow redirect status codes such as 301. You can use the urlchecker package to reproduce these checks and, in particular, replace URLs with the URLs they redirect to. Others have used the option to escape some URLs (change <https://ropensci.org/> to https://ropensci.org/, or \\url{https://ropensci.org/} to https://ropensci.org/.), but if you do so, you will need to implement some sort of URL checking yourself to prevent them from getting broken without your noticing. Furthermore, links would not be clickable from local docs."

    "section": "\n1.8 Documentation website",
    "text": "1.8 Documentation website\nWe recommend creating a documentation website for your package using pkgdown. Neal Richardson wrote a good tutorial to get started with pkgdown, and unsurprisingly pkgdown has its own documentation website.\nThere are a few elements we’d like to underline here.\n\n1.8.1 Automatic deployment of the documentation website\nYou only need to worry about automatic deployment of your website until approval and transfer of your package repo to the ropensci organization; indeed, after that a pkgdown website will be built for your package after each push to the GitHub repo. You can find the status of these builds at https://dev.ropensci.org/job/package_name, e.g. for magick; and the website at https://docs.ropensci.org/package_name, e.g. for magick. The website build will use your pkgdown config file if you have one, except for the styling that will use the rotemplate package. The resulting website will have a local search bar. Please report bugs, questions and feature requests about the central builds at https://github.com/ropensci/docs/ and about the template at https://github.com/ropensci/rotemplate/.\nIf your package vignettes need credentials (API keys, tokens, etc.) to knit, you might want to precompute them since credentials cannot be used on the docs server.\nBefore submission and before transfer, you could use the approach documented by pkgdown or the tic package for automatic deployment of the package’s website. This would save you the hassle of running (and remembering to run) pkgdown::build_site() yourself every time the site needs to be updated. First refer to our chapter on continuous integration if you’re not familiar with continuous integration. In any case, do not forget to update all occurrences of the website URL after transfer to the ropensci organization.\n\n1.8.2 Grouping functions in the reference\nWhen your package has many functions, use grouping in the reference, which you can do more or less automatically.\nIf you use roxygen2 above version 6.1.1, you should use the @family tag in your functions documentation to indicate grouping. This will give you links between functions in the local documentation of the installed package (“See also” section) and allow you to use the pkgdown has_concept function in the config file of your website. Non-rOpenSci example courtesy of optiRum: family tag, pkgdown config file and resulting reference section. To customize the text of the cross-reference title created by roxygen2 (Other {family}:), refer to roxygen2 docs regarding how to provide a rd_family_title list in man/roxygen/meta.R.\nLess automatically, see the example of drake website and associated config file.\n\n1.8.3 Branding of authors\nYou can make the names of (some) authors clickable by adding their URL, and you can even replace their names with a logo (think rOpenSci… or your organisation/company!). See pkgdown documentation.\n\n1.8.4 Tweaking the navbar\nYou can make your website content easier to browse by tweaking the navbar, refer to pkgdown documentation. In particular, note that if you name the main vignette of your package “pkg-name.Rmd”, it’ll be accessible from the navbar as a Get started link instead of via Articles > Vignette Title.\n\n1.8.5 Mathjax\nOnce your package is transferred and it gets a website using our pkgdown template, if you want to use Mathjax you’ll need to specify it in the pkgdown config file like so:\ntemplate:\n  params:\n    mathjax: true\n\n1.8.6 Package logo\nTo use your package logo in the pkgdown homepage, refer to usethis::use_logo(). If your package doesn’t have any logo, the rOpenSci docs builder will use rOpenSci logo instead."

    "text": "1.9 Authorship\nThe DESCRIPTION file of a package should list package authors and contributors to a package, using the Authors@R syntax to indicate their roles (author/creator/contributor etc.) if there is more than one author, and using the comment field to indicate the ORCID ID of each author, if they have one (cf this post). See this section of “Writing R Extensions” for details. If you feel that your reviewers have made a substantial contribution to the development of your package, you may list them in the Authors@R field with a Reviewer contributor type (\"rev\"), like so:\n    person(\"Bea\", \"Hernández\", role = \"rev\",\n    comment = \"Bea reviewed the package (v. X.X.XX) for rOpenSci, see <https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/116>\"),\nOnly include reviewers after asking for their consent. Read more in this blog post “Thanking Your Reviewers: Gratitude through Semantic Metadata”. Please do not list editors as contributors. Your participation in and contribution to rOpenSci is thanks enough!\n\n1.9.1 Authorship of included code\nMany packages include code from other software. Whether entire files or single functions are included from other packages, rOpenSci packages should follow the CRAN Repository Policy:\n\nThe ownership of copyright and intellectual property rights of all components of the package must be clear and unambiguous (including from the authors specification in the DESCRIPTION file). Where code is copied (or derived) from the work of others (including from R itself), care must be taken that any copyright/license statements are preserved and authorship is not misrepresented.\nPreferably, an ‘Authors@R’ field would be used with ‘ctb’ roles for the authors of such code. Alternatively, the ‘Author’ field should list these authors as contributors.\nWhere copyrights are held by an entity other than the package authors, this should preferably be indicated via ‘cph’ roles in the ‘Authors@R’ field, or using a ‘Copyright’ field (if necessary referring to an inst/COPYRIGHTS file).\nTrademarks must be respected."

    "text": "1.11 Testing\n\nAll packages should pass R CMD check/devtools::check() on all major platforms.\nAll packages should have a test suite that covers major functionality of the package. The tests should also cover the behavior of the package in case of errors.\nIt is good practice to write unit tests for all functions, and all package code in general, ensuring key functionality is covered. Test coverage below 75% will likely require additional tests or explanation before being sent for review.\nWe recommend using testthat for writing tests. Strive to write tests as you write each new function. This serves the obvious need to have proper testing for the package, but allows you to think about various ways in which a function can fail, and to defensively code against those. More information.\nTests should be easy to understand. We suggest reading the blog post “Why Good Developers Write Bad Unit Tests” by Michael Lynch.\nPackages with Shiny apps should use a unit-testing framework such as shinytest to test that interactive interfaces behave as expected.\nFor testing your functions creating plots, we suggest using vdiffr, an extension of the testthat package; or testthat snapshot tests.\n\nIf your package interacts with web resources (web APIs and other sources of data on the web) you might find the HTTP testing in R book by Scott Chamberlain and Maëlle Salmon relevant. Packages helping with HTTP testing (corresponding HTTP clients):\n\n\nhttptest2 (httr2);\n\nhttptest (httr);\n\nvcr (httr, crul);\n\nwebfakes (httr, httr2, crul, curl).\n\n\ntestthat has a function skip_on_cran() that you can use to not run tests on CRAN. We recommend using this on all functions that are API calls since they are quite likely to fail on CRAN. These tests should still run on continuous integration. Note that from testthat 3.1.2 skip_if_offline() automatically calls skip_on_cran(). More info on CRAN preparedness for API wrappers.\nIf your package interacts with a database you might find dittodb useful.\nOnce you’ve set up continuous integration (CI), use your package’s code coverage report (cf this section of our book) to identify untested lines, and to add further tests.\nEven if you use continuous integration, we recommend that you run tests locally prior to submitting your package, as some tests are often skipped (you may need to set Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN=\"true\") in order to ensure all tests are run). In addition, we recommend that prior to submitting your package, you use MangoTheCat’s goodpractice package to check your package for likely sources of errors, and run spelling::spell_check_package() to find spelling errors in documentation."

In addition to demonstrating how to use the package, these can act as an easy way to test package functionality before there are proper tests. However, keep in mind we require tests in contributed packages.\nYou can run examples with devtools::run_examples(). Note that when you run R CMD CHECK or equivalent (e.g., devtools::check()) your examples that are not wrapped in \\dontrun{} or \\donttest{} are run. Refer to the summary table in roxygen2 docs.\nTo safe-guard examples (e.g. requiring authentication) to be run on CRAN you need to use \\dontrun{}. However, for a first submission CRAN won’t let you have all examples escaped so. In this case you might add some small toy examples, or wrap example code in try(). Also refer to the @exampleIf tag present, at the time of writing, in roxygen2 development version.\nIn addition to running examples locally on your own computer, we strongly advise that you run examples on one of the continuous integration systems. Again, examples that are not wrapped in \\dontrun{} or \\donttest{} will be run, but for those that are you can configure your continuous integration builds to run them via R CMD check arguments --run-dontrun and/or --run-donttest."

    "section": "\n1.13 Package dependencies",
    "text": "1.13 Package dependencies\n\nUse Imports instead of Depends for packages providing functions from other packages. Make sure to list packages used for testing (testthat), and documentation (knitr, roxygen2) in your Suggests section of package dependencies (if you use usethis for adding testing infrastructure via usethis::use_testthat() or a vignette via usethis::use_vignette(), the necessary packages will be added to DESCRIPTION). If you use any package in the examples or tests of your package, make sure to list it in Suggests, if not already listed in Imports.\n\nIf your (not Bioconductor) package depends on Bioconductor packages, make sure the installation instructions in the README and vignette are clear enough even for an user who is not familiar with the Bioconductor release cycle.\n\nShould the user use BiocManager (recommended)? Document this.\nIs the automatic installation of Bioconductor packages by install.packages() enough? In that case, mention that the user needs to run setRepositories() if they haven’t set the necessary Bioconductor repositories yet.\nIf your package depends on Bioconductor after a certain version, mention it in DESCRIPTION and in the installation instructions.\n\n\nSpecifying minimum dependencies (e.g. glue (>= 1.3.0) instead of just glue) should be a conscious choice. If you know for a fact that your package will break below a certain dependency version, specify it explicitly. But if you don’t, then no need to specify a minimum dependency. In that case when a user reports a bug which is explicitly related to an older version of a dependency then address it then. An example of bad practice would be for a developer to consider the versions of their current state of dependencies to be the minimal version. That would needlessly force everyone to upgrade (causing issues with other packages) when there is no good reason behind that version choice.\nFor most cases where you must expose functions from dependencies to the user, you should import and re-export those individual functions rather than listing them in the Depends fields. For instance, if functions in your package produce raster objects, you might re-export only printing and plotting functions from the raster package.\n\nIf your package uses a system dependency, you should\n\nIndicate it in DESCRIPTION;\nCheck that it is listed by sysreqsdb to allow automatic tools to install it, and submit a contribution if not;\nCheck for it in a configure script (example) and give a helpful error message if it cannot be found (example). configure scripts can be challenging as they often require hacky solutions to make diverse system dependencies work across systems. Use examples (more here) as a starting point but note that it is common to encounter bugs and edge cases and often violate CRAN policies. Do not hesitate to ask for help on our forum.\n\n\n\nConsider the trade-offs involved in relying on a package as a dependency. On one hand, using dependencies reduces coding effort, and can build on useful functionality developed by others, especially if the dependency performs complex tasks, is high-performance, and/or is well vetted and tested. On the other hand, having many dependencies places a burden on the maintainer to keep up with changes in those packages, at risk to your package’s long-term sustainability. It also increases installation time and size, primarily a consideration on your and others’ development cycle, and in automated build systems. “Heavy” packages - those with many dependencies themselves, and those with large amounts of compiled code - increase this cost. Here are some approaches to reducing dependencies:\n\n\nSmall, simple functions from a dependency package may be better copied into your own package if the dependency if you are using only a few functions in an otherwise large or heavy dependency. (See Authorship section above for how to acknowledge original authors of copied code.) On the other hand, complex functions with many edge cases (e.g. parsers) require considerable testing and vetting.\n\n\nAn common example of this is in returning tidyverse-style “tibbles” from package functions that provide data. One can avoid the modestly heavy tibble package dependency by returning a tibble created by modifying a data frame like so:\nclass(df) <- c(\"tbl_df\", \"tbl\", \"data.frame\") \n(Note that this approach is not universally endorsed.)\n\n\n\nEnsure that you are using the package where the function is defined, rather than one where it is re-exported. For instance many functions in devtools can be found in smaller specialty packages such as sessioninfo. The %>% function should be imported from magrittr, where it is defined, rather than the heavier dplyr, which re-exports it.\nSome dependencies are preferred because they provide easier to interpret function names and syntax than base R solutions. If this is the primary reason for using a function in a heavy dependency, consider wrapping the base R approach in a nicely-named internal function in your package. See e.g. the rlang R script providing functions with a syntax similar to purrr functions.\nIf dependencies have overlapping functionality, see if you can rely on only one.\nMore dependency-management tips can be found in this post by Scott Chamberlain."

Different services support different operating system configurations.\nGitHub Actions is a convenient option for many R developers who already use GitHub as it is integrated into the platform and supports all needed operating Systems. There are actions supported for the R ecosystem, as well and first-class support in the {usethis} package. All packages submitted to rOpenSci for peer review are checked by our own pkgcheck system, described further in the Guide for Authors. These checks are also provided as a GitHub Action in the ropensci-review-tools/pkgcheck-action repository. Packages authors are encouraged to use that action to confirm prior to submission that a package passes all of our checks. See our blog post for more information.\nusethis supports CI setup for other systems, though these functions are soft-deprecated. rOpenSci also supports the circle package, which aids in setting up CircleCI pipelines, and the tic package for building more complicated CI pipelines.\n\n2.3.0.1 Testing using different versions of R\nWe require that rOpenSci packages are tested against the latest, previous and development versions of R to ensure both backwards and forwards compatibility with base R.\nDetails of how to run tests/checks using different versions of R locally can be found in the R-hub vignette on running Local Linux checks with Docker.\nYou can fine tune the deployment of tests with each versions by using a testing matrix.\nIf you develop a package depending on or intended for Bioconductor, you might find biocthis relevant.\n\n2.3.0.2 Minimizing build times on CI\nYou can use these tips to minimize build time on CI:\n\nCache installation of packages.

Also refer to the httr vignette about sharing secrets.\n\n3.4.1 Secrets in packages and user protection\nSay your package needs an API key for making requests on behalf of users of your package.\n\n\nIn your package documentation, guide the user so the API key doesn’t end up in the .Rhistory/script of users of your package.\n\nEncourage the use of environment variables to store the API key (or even remove the possibility to pass it as an argument to the functions?). You could link to this intro to startup files and usethis::edit_r_environ().\nOr your package could depend on, or encourage the use of, keyring to help user store variables in the specific OS’ credential stores (more secure than .Renviron): i.e. you’d create a function for setting the key, and have another one for retrieving the key; or the user would write Sys.setenv(SUPERSECRETKEY = keyring::key_get(\"myservice\")) at the beginning of their script.\nDo not print the API key even in verbose mode in any message, warning, error.\n\n\nIn the GitHub issue template, it should be stated not to share any credentials. If an user of your package accidentally shares credentials in an issue, make sure they’re aware of that so they can revoke the key (i.e. ask them explicitly in an answer whether they realized they shared their key).\n\n3.4.2 Secrets in packages and development\nYou’ll need to protect your secrets as you protect secrets of users, but there’s more to take into account and keep in mind.\n\n3.4.2.1 Secrets and recorded requests in tests\nIf you use vcr or httptest in tests for caching API responses, you need to make sure the recorded requests / fixtures do not contain secrets. Refer to vcr security guidance and httptest guidance “Redacting and Modifying Recorded Requests”, and inspect your recorded requests / fixtures before committing them the first time to be sure you got the setup right.\nvcr being an rOpenSci package, you can post any question you might have to rOpenSci forum.\n\n3.4.2.2 Share secrets with CI services\nNow, you might need to share secrets with continuous integration services.\nYou could store API keys as environment variables / secrets, referring to the docs of the CI service.\nFor more details and workflow advice, refer to the gargle article “Managing tokens securely” and the security chapter of the HTTP testing in R book.\nDocument the steps you made in CONTRIBUTING.md so you, or say a new maintainer, can remember how to do that next time.\n\n3.4.2.3 Secrets and collaborations\nWhat about pull requests from external contributors? Tests using your secrets will fail unless you use some sort of mocked/cached response, so you might want to skip them depending on the context. For instance, in your CI account you could create an environment variable called THIS_IS_ME and then skip tests based on the presence of this variable. This obviously means the PR checks by the CI are not exhaustive, so you’ll need to check out the PR locally to run all tests.\nDocument the behavior of your package for external PRs in CONTRIBUTING.md for the sake of people making PRs and of people reviewing them (you in a few weeks, and other authors of the package).\n\n3.4.3 Secrets and CRAN\nOn CRAN, skip any tests (skip_on_cran()) and examples (dontrun) requiring credentials.\nPrecompute vignettes requiring credentials."

    "text": "4.1 What is rOpenSci Software Peer Review?\nrOpenSci’s suite of packages is partly contributed by staff members and partly contributed by community members, which means the suite stems from a great diversity of skills and experience of developers. How to ensure quality for the whole set? That’s where software peer review comes into play: packages contributed by the community undergo a transparent, constructive, non adversarial and open review process. For that process relying mostly on volunteer work, associate editors manage the incoming flow and ensure progress of submissions; authors create, submit and improve their package; reviewers, two per submission, examine the software code and user experience. This blog post written by rOpenSci editors is a good introduction to rOpenSci software peer review Other blog posts about review itself and reviewed packages can be find via the “software-peer-review” tag on rOpenSci blog.\nYou can recognize rOpenSci packages that have been peer-reviewed via a green “peer-reviewed” badge in their README, linking to their reviews (cf this example); and via a blue comment icon near their description on rOpenSci packages page, also linking to the reviews.\nTechnically, we make the most of GitHub infrastructure: each package review process is an issue in the ropensci/software-review GitHub repository. For instance, click here to read the review thread of the ropenaq package: the process is an ongoing conversation until acceptance of the package, with two external reviews as important milestones. Furthermore, we use GitHub features such as the use of issue templates (as submission templates), and labelling which we use to track progress of submissions (from editor checks to approval)."

Both authors and reviewers report that they enjoy and learn more from this open and direct exchange. It also has the benefit of building a community. Participants have the opportunity to meaningfully network with new peers, and new collaborations have emerged via ideas spawned during the review process.\nWe are aware that open systems can have drawbacks. For instance, in traditional academic review, double-blind peer review can increase representation of female authors, suggesting bias in non-blind reviews. It is also possible reviewers are less critical in open review. However, we posit that the openness of the review conversation provides a check on review quality and bias; it’s harder to inject unsupported or subjective comments in public and without the cover of anonymity. Ultimately, we believe that having direct and public communication between authors and reviewers improves quality and fairness of reviews.\nFurthermore, authors and reviewers have the ability to contact privately the editors if they have any doubt or question."

    "section": "\n5.1 Review process",
    "text": "5.1 Review process\n\nFor a package to be considered for the rOpenSci suite, package authors must initiate a request on the ropensci/software-review repository.\nPackages are reviewed for quality, fit, documentation, clarity and the review process is quite similar to a manuscript review (see our packaging guide and reviewing guide for more details). Unlike a manuscript review, this process will be an ongoing conversation.\nOnce all major issues and questions, and those addressable with reasonable effort, are resolved, the editor assigned to a package will make a decision (accept, hold, or reject). Rejections are usually done early (before the review process begins, see the aims and scope section), but in rare cases a package may also be not onboarded after review & revision. It is ultimately editor’s decision on whether or not to reject the package based on how the reviews are addressed.\nCommunication between authors, reviewers and editors will first and foremost take place on GitHub, although you can choose to contact the editor by email or Slack for some issues. When submitting a package, please make sure your GitHub notification settings make it unlikely you will miss a comment.\nThe author can choose to have their submission put on hold (editor applies the holding label). The holding status will be revisited every 3 months, and after one year the issue will be closed.\nIf the author hasn’t requested a holding label, but is simply not responding, we should close the issue within one month after the last contact intent. This intent will include a comment tagging the author, but also an email using the email address listed in the DESCRIPTION of the package which is one of the rare cases where the editor will try to contact the author by email.\nIf a submission is closed and the author wishes to re-submit, they’ll have to start a new submission. If the package is still in scope, the author will have to respond to the initial reviews before the editor starts looking for new reviewers.\n\n\n5.1.1 Publishing in other Venues\n\nWe strongly suggest submitting your package for review before publishing on CRAN or submitting a software paper describing the package to a journal. Review feedback may result in major improvements and updates to your package, including renaming and breaking changes to functions. We do not consider previous publication on CRAN or in other venues sufficient reason to not adopt reviewer or editor recommendations.\nDo not submit your package for review while it or an associated manuscript is also under review at another venue, as this may result on conflicting requests for changes.\n\n5.1.2 Conflict of interest for reviewers/editors\nFollowing criteria are meant to be a guide for what constitutes a conflict of interest for an editor or reviewer. The potential editor or reviewer has a conflict of interest if:\n\nThe authors with a major role are from the potential reviewer/editor’s institution or institutional component (e.g., department)\nWithin in the past three years, the potential reviewer/editor has been a collaborator or has had any other professional relationship with any person on the package who has a major role\nThe potential reviewer/editor serves as a member of the advisory board for the project under review\nThe potential reviewer/editor would receive a direct or indirect financial benefit if the package is accepted\nThe potential reviewer/editor has significantly contributed to a competitor project.\nThere is also a lifetime COI for the family members, business partners, and thesis student/advisor or mentor.\n\nIn the case where none of the associate editors can serve as editor, an external guest editor will be recruited."

    "section": "\n5.2 Aims and Scope",
    "text": "5.2 Aims and Scope\nrOpenSci aims to support packages that enable reproducible research and managing the data lifecycle for scientists. Packages submitted to rOpenSci should fit into one or more of the categories outlined either below. Statistical software may also be submitted for peer review, for which we have a separate set of guidelines and standards. The categories below are for general, and not statistical, software, while the remainder of this chapter applies to both kinds of software. If you are unsure whether your package fits into one of the general or statistical categories, please open an issue as a pre-submission inquiry (Examples).\nAs this is a living document, these categories may change through time and not all previously onboarded packages would be in-scope today. For instance, data visualization packages are no longer in-scope. While we strive to be consistent, we evaluate packages on a case-by-case basis and may make exceptions.\nNote that not all rOpenSci projects and packages are in-scope or go through peer review. Projects developed by staff or at conferences may be experimental, exploratory, address core infrastructure priorities and thus not fall into these categories. Look for the peer-review badge - see below - to identify peer-reviewed packages in the rOpenSci repository.\n\n\nexample of a green peer-reviewed badge\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Package categories\n\ndata retrieval: Packages for accessing and downloading data from online sources with scientific applications. Our definition of scientific applications is broad, including data storage services, journals, and other remote servers, as many data sources may be of interest to researchers. However, retrieval packages should be focused on data sources / topics, rather than services. For example a general client for Amazon Web Services data storage would not be in-scope. (Examples: rotl, gutenbergr)\ndata extraction: Packages that aid in retrieving data from unstructured sources such as text, images and PDFs, as well as parsing scientific data types and outputs from scientific equipment. Statistical/ML libraries for modeling or prediction are typically not included in this category, nor are code parsers. Trained models that act as utilities (e.g., for optical character recognition), may qualify. (Examples: tabulizer for extracting tables from PDF documents, genbankr for parsing files from GenBank, treeio for phylogentic reading in phylogentic tree files, lightr for parsing files from spectroscopic instruments))\ndata munging: Packages for processing data from formats above. This area does not include broad data manipulations tools such as reshape2 or tidyr, or tools for extracting data from R code itself. Rather, it focuses on tools for handling data in specific scientific formats generated from scientific workflows or exported from scientific instruments. (Examples: plateR for reading in data structured as plate maps for scientific instruments, or phonfieldwork for processing annotated audio files for phonics research)\ndata deposition: Packages that support deposition of data into research repositories, including data formatting and metadata generation. (Example: EML)\ndata validation and testing: Tools that enable automated validation and checking of data quality and completeness as part of scientific workflows. (Example: assertr)\nworkflow automation: Tools that automate and link together workflows, such as build systems and tools to manage continuous integration. Does not include general tools for literate programming. (e.g., R markdown extensions not under the previous topics). (Example: drake)\nversion control: Tools that facilitate the use of version control in scientific workflows. Note that this does not include all tools that interact with online version control services (e.g., GitHub), unless they fit into another category. (Example: git2rdata)\ncitation management and bibliometrics: Tools that facilitate managing references, such as for writing manuscripts, creating CVs or otherwise attributing scientific contributions, or accessing, manipulating or otherwise working with bibliometric data. (Example: RefManageR)\nscientific software wrappers: Packages that wrap non-R utility programs used for scientific research. These programs must be specific to research fields, not general computing utilities. Wrappers must be non-trivial, in that there must be significant added value above simple system() call or bindings, whether in parsing inputs and outputs, data handling, etc. Improved installation process, or extension of compatibility to more platforms, may constitute added value if installation is complex. This does not include wrappers of other R packages or C/C++ libraries that can be included in R packages. We strongly encourage wrapping open-source and open-licensed utilities - exceptions will be evaluated case-by-case, considering whether open-source options exist. (Examples: babette, nlrx)\nfield and laboratory reproducibility tools: Packages that improve reproducibility of real-world workflows through standardization and automation of field and lab protocols, such as sample tracking and tagging, form and data sheet generation, interfacing with laboratory equipment or information systems, and executing experimental designs. (Example: baRcodeR)\ndatabase software bindings: Bindings and wrappers for generic database APIs (Example: rrlite)\n\nIn addition, we have some specialty topics with a slightly broader scope.\n\ngeospatial data: We accept packages focused on accessing geospatial data, manipulating geospatial data, and converting between geospatial data formats. (Examples: osmplotr, tidync).\ntext data: We include packages that process and manage text and language data. This is limited to text processing/munging/management (e.g., tokenization, stemming, conversion to and between structured text formats, text metadata and repository access, etc. ). Machine-learning and packages implementing NLP analysis algorithms should be submitted under statistical software peer review. The scope for this topic is not fully defined, please open a pre-submission inquiry if you are considering submitting a package that falls under this topic. (Example: tokenizers)\n\n5.2.2 Other scope considerations\nPackages should be general in the sense that they should solve a problem as broadly as possible while maintaining a coherent user interface and code base. For instance, if several data sources use an identical API, we prefer a package that provides access to all the data sources, rather than just one.\nPackages that include interactive tools to facilitate researcher workflows (e.g., shiny apps) must have a mechanism to make the interactive workflow reproducible, such as code generation or a scriptable API.\nFor packages that are not in the scope of rOpenSci, we encourage submitting them to CRAN, BioConductor, as well as other R package development initiatives (e.g., cloudyr), and software journals such as JOSS, JSS, or the R journal, depending on the current scopes of those journals.\nNote that the packages developed internally by rOpenSci, through our events or through collaborations are not all in-scope for our Software Peer Review process.\n\n5.2.3 Package overlap\nrOpenSci encourages competition among packages, forking and re-implementation as they improve options of users overall. However, as we want packages in the rOpenSci suite to be our top recommendations for the tasks they perform, we aim to avoid duplication of functionality of existing R packages in any repo without significant improvements. An R package that replicates the functionality of an existing R package may be considered for inclusion in the rOpenSci suite if it significantly improves on alternatives in any repository (RO, CRAN, BioC) by being:\n\nMore open in licensing or development practices\nBroader in functionality (e.g., providing access to more data sets, providing a greater suite of functions), but not only by duplicating additional packages\nBetter in usability and performance\nActively maintained while alternatives are poorly or no longer actively maintained\n\nThese factors should be considered as a whole to determine if the package is a significant improvement. A new package would not meet this standard only by following our package guidelines while others do not, unless this leads to a significant difference in the areas above.\nWe recommend that packages highlight differences from and improvements over overlapping packages in their README and/or vignettes.\nWe encourage developers whose packages are not accepted due to overlap to still consider submittal to other repositories or journals."

    "text": "5.3 Package ownership and maintenance\n\n5.3.1 Role of the rOpenSci team\nAuthors of contributed packages essentially maintain the same ownership they had prior to their package joining the rOpenSci suite. Package authors will continue to maintain and develop their software after acceptance into rOpenSci. Unless explicitly added as collaborators, the rOpenSci team will not interfere much with day to day operations. However, this team may intervene with critical bug fixes, or address urgent issues if package authors do not respond in a timely manner (see the section about maintainer responsiveness).\n\n5.3.2 Maintainer responsiveness\nIf package maintainers do not respond in a timely manner to requests for package fixes from CRAN or from us, we will remind the maintainer a number of times, but after 3 months (or shorter time frame, depending on how critical the fix is) we will make the changes ourselves.\nThe above is a bit vague, so the following are a few areas of consideration.\n\nExamples where we’d want to move quickly:\n\nPackage foo is imported by one or more packages on CRAN, and foo is broken, and thus would break its reverse dependencies.\nPackage bar may not have reverse dependencies on CRAN, but is widely used, thus quickly fixing problems is of greater importance.\n\n\nExamples where we can wait longer:\n\nPackage hello is not on CRAN, or on CRAN, but has no reverse dependencies.\nPackage world needs some fixes. The maintainer has responded but is simply very busy with a new job, or other reason, and will attend to soon.\n\n\n\nWe urge package maintainers to make sure they are receiving GitHub notifications, as well as making sure emails from rOpenSci staff and CRAN maintainers are not going to their spam box. Authors of onboarded packages will be invited to the rOpenSci Slack to chat with the rOpenSci team and the greater rOpenSci community. Anyone can also discuss with the rOpenSci community on the rOpenSci discussion forum.\nShould authors abandon the maintenance of an actively used package in our suite, we will consider petitioning CRAN to transfer package maintainer status to rOpenSci.\n\n5.3.3 Quality commitment\nrOpenSci strives to develop and promote high quality research software. To ensure that your software meets our criteria, we review all of our submissions as part of the Software Peer Review process, and even after acceptance will continue to step in with improvements and bug fixes.\nDespite our best efforts to support contributed software, errors are the responsibility of individual maintainers. Buggy, unmaintained software may be removed from our suite at any time.\n\n5.3.4 Package removal\nIn the unlikely scenario that a contributor of a package requests removal of their package from the suite, we retain the right to maintain a version of the package in our suite for archival purposes."

    "text": "5.4 Ethics, Data Privacy and Human Subjects Research\nrOpenSci packages and other tools are used for a variety of purposes, but our focus is on tools for research. We expect that tools will enable ethical use by research practitioners, who are obligated to adhere to ethical codes such Declaration of Helsinki and The Belmont Report. Researchers bear responsibility for their use of software, but software developers must consider the ethical use of their products, and developers themselves adhere to ethical codes for computer professionals such as those expressed by IEEE and ACM. rOpenSci contributors often play both the role of both researcher and developer.\nWe ask that software developers place themselves in researchers’ role and consider the requirements of an ethical workflow using authors’ software. Given the variation and degree of flux of ethical approaches for Internet-based analyses, judgement calls rather than recipes are required. The Ethical Guidelines of The Association of Internet Researchers provides a robust framework and we encourage authors, editors, and reviewers to use this in evaluating their work. In general, adherence to legal or regulatory minimum requirements may not be sufficient, though these (e.g., GDPR), may be relevant. Package authors should direct users to relevant resources for the ethical use of the software.\nSome packages, due to the nature of data they handle, may be determined by editors to require enhanced scrutiny. For these, editors may require additional (or reduced) functionality, and robust documentation, defaults, and warnings to direct users to relevant ethical practices. The following topics may merit enhanced scrutiny:\n\nVulnerable populations: Authors of packages and workflows that deal with information related to vulnerable populations bear responsibility to protect them from likely harms.\nPersonally identifiable or sensitive data: The release of personally identifiable or sensitive data is potentially harmful. This includes “reasonably re-identifiable” data - which a motivated individual could trace back to the owner or creator even if the data are anonymized. This includes both cases where identifiers (e.g., name, date of birth) are available as part of data, and also if unique pseudonyms/screen names are linked with full-text posts, through which one can link back individuals through cross-reference with other data sets.\n\nWhile the best response to ethical concerns will be context-specific, these general guidelines should be followed by packages where the challenges above arise:\n\nPackages should adhere to data source’s terms of use, as expressed in website Terms and Conditions, “robots.txt” files, privacy policies, and other relevant restrictions, and link to them prominently in package documentation. Packages should provide or document functionality to adhere to such restrictions (e.g., scrape from only allowed endpoints, use appropriate rate limiting in code, examples, or vignettes). Note that while Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policies, etc., may not provide sufficient bounds on ethical usage, they can provide an outer bound.\n\nA key tool in addressing the risks posed in studying vulnerable populations or using personally identifiable data is informed consent. Package authors should support users’ acquisition of informed consent when relevant. This may include providing links to data source’s preferred method of acquiring consent, contact information of data providers (e.g. forum moderators), documentation of informed consent protocols, or getting pre-approval for general uses of a package.\nNote that consent is not implicitly granted just because data are accessible. Accessible data are not necessarily public, as different persons and contexts have different normative expectations of privacy (see work by Social Data Lab).\n\nPackages accessing personally identifiable information should take special care to follow [security best practices][Package Development Security Best Practices] (e.g., exclusive use of secure internet protocols, strong mechanisms for storing credentials, etc.).\nPackages that access or handle personally identifiable or sensitive data should enable, document, and demonstrate workflows for de-identification, secure storage, other best practices to minimize risk of harm.\n\nAs standards for data privacy and research continue to evolve, we welcome input from authors on considerations specific to their software and supplemental documentation such as approval from university ethics review boards. These may be attached to issue threads of package submissions or pre-submission inquiries, or conveyed directly to editors if needed. General suggestions may be filed as issues in this book’s repository.\n\n5.4.1 Resources\nThe following resources may be helpful for researchers, package authors, editors and reviewers in addressing ethical questions related to privacy and research software.\n\nThe Declaration of Helsinki and The Belmont Report provide fundamental principles for ethical practice by researchers.\nSeveral organizations provide guidance on how to translate these principles into the context of internet research. These include the Ethical Guidelines of The Association of Internet Researchers, the NESH Guide to Internet Research Ethics, and BPS’ Ethics Guidelines for Internet-Mediated Research. Anabo et al (2019) provide a helpful overview of these.\nThe Social Media Lab provides a high-level overview with data on normative expectations of privacy and use on social forums.\nBechmann A., Kim J.Y.

Your package should be sufficiently mature so that reviewers are able to review all essential aspects, but keep in mind that review may result in major changes.\n\nWe strongly suggest submitting your package for review before publishing on CRAN or submitting a software paper describing the package to a journal. Review feedback may result in major improvements and updates to your package, including renaming and breaking changes to functions.\nDo not submit your package for review while it or an associated manuscript is also under review at another venue, as this may result in conflicting requests for changes.\n\n\nPlease also consider the time and effort needed to respond to reviews: think about your availability or that of your collaborators in the next weeks and months following a submission. Note that reviewers are volunteers, and we ask that you respect their time and effort by responding in a timely and respectful manner.\nIf you use repostatus.org badges (which we recommend), submit when you’re ready to get an Active instead of WIP badge. Similarly, if you use lifecycle badges, submission should happen when the package is at least Maturing.\nFor any submission or pre-submission inquiry the README of your package should provide enough information about your package (goals, usage, similar packages) for the editors to assess its scope without having to install the package. Even better, set up a pkgdown website for allowing more detailed assessment of functionality online.\n\nAt the submission stage, all major functions should be stable enough to be fully documented and tested; the README should make a strong case for the package.\nYour README file should strive to explain your package’s functionality and aims, assuming readers have little to no domain knowledge. All technical tems, including references to other software, should be clarified.\n\n\nYour package will continue to evolve after review, the chapter on Package evolution provides guidance about the topic."

Your response should include a link to the updated NEWS.md of your package. Here is an author response example. We encourage ongoing conversations between authors and reviewers. See the reviewing guide for more details.\nAny time package changes are likely to alter the results of the automated pkgcheck checks, authors can request a re-check with the command, @ropensci-review-bot check package.\nPlease notify us immediately if you are no longer able to maintain your package or to respond to reviews. You will then be expected to either retract a submission, or to find alternative package maintainers.

If the package has changed substantially since the last checks, you may request a re-check with the command @ropensci-review-bot check package. Note that when installing the package to review it, you should use the dependencies = TRUE argument of remotes::install() to make sure you have all dependencies available.\n\n7.1.1 General guidelines\nTo review a package, please begin by copying our review template (or our review template in Spanish) and using it as a high-level checklist. In addition to checking off the minimum criteria, we ask that you provide general comments addressing the following:\n\nDoes the code comply with general principles in the Mozilla reviewing guide?\nDoes the package comply with the rOpenSci packaging guide?\nAre there improvements that could be made to the code style?\nIs there code duplication in the package that should be reduced?\nAre there user interface improvements that could be made?\nAre there performance improvements that could be made?\nIs the documentation (installation instructions/vignettes/examples/demos) clear and sufficient? Does it use the principle of multiple points of entry i.e. takes into account the fact that any piece of documentation may be the first encounter the user has with the package and/or the tool/data it wraps?\nWere functions and arguments named to work together to form a common, logical programming API that is easy to read, and autocomplete?\nIf you have your own relevant data/problem, work through it with the package. You may find rough edges and use-cases the author didn’t think about.\n\nPlease be respectful and kind to the authors in your reviews. Our code of conduct is mandatory for everyone involved in our review process. We expect you to submit your review within 3 weeks, depending on the deadline set by the editor. Please contact the editor directly or in the submission thread to inform them about possible delays.\nWe encourage you to use automated tools to facilitate your reviewing. These include:\n\nChecking the initial package report generated by our @ropensci-review-bot.\nChecking the package’s logs on its continuous integration services (GitHub Actions, Codecov, etc.)\nRunning devtools::check() and devtools::test() on the package to find any errors that may be missed on the author’s system.\nSeeing whether tests’ skipping is justified (e.g. skip_on_cran() tests that do real API requests vs. skipping all tests on one operating system).\n\nReviewers may also re-generate package check results from @ropensci-review-bot at any time by issuing the single comment in a review issue: @ropensci-review-bot check package.\n\n7.1.2 Off-thread interactions\nIf you interact with the package authors and talked about the review outside a review thread (in chats, DMs, in-person, issues in the project repository), please make sure that your review captures and/or links to elements from these conversations that are relevant to the process.\n\n7.1.3 Experience from past reviewers\nFirst-time reviewers may find it helpful to read (about) some previous reviews. In general you can find submission threads of onboarded packages here. Here are a few chosen examples of reviews (note that your reviews do not need to be as long as these examples):\n\nrtika review 1 and review 2\nNLMR review 1 and review 2\nbowerbird pre-review comment, review 1, review 2.\nrusda review (from before we had a review template)\n\nYou can read blog posts written by reviewers about their experiences via this link. In particular, in this blog post by Mara Averick read about the “naive user” role a reviewer can take to provide useful feedback even without being experts of the package’s topic or implementation, by asking themselves “What did I think this thing would do? Does it do it? What are things that scare me off?”. In another blog post Verena Haunschmid explains how she alternated between using the package and checking its code.\nAs both a former reviewer and package author Adam Sparks wrote this “[write] a good critique of the package structure and best coding practices. If you know how to do something better, tell me. It’s easy to miss documentation opportunities as a developer, as a reviewer, you have a different view. You’re a user that can give feedback. What’s not clear in the package? How can it be made more clear? If you’re using it for the first time, is it easy? Do you know another R package that maybe I should be using? Or is there one I’m using that perhaps I shouldn’t be? If you can contribute to the package, offer.”\n\n7.1.4 Helper package for reviewers\nIf working in RStudio, you can streamline your review workflow by using the pkgreviewr package created by associated editor Anna Krystalli. Say you accepted to review the refnet package, you’d write\nremotes::install_github(\"ropensci-org/pkgreviewr\")\nlibrary(pkgreviewr)\npkgreview_create(pkg_repo = \"embruna/refnet\", \n                 review_parent = \"~/Documents/workflows/rOpenSci/reviews/\")\nand\n\nthe GitHub repo of the refnet package will be cloned.\na review project will be created, containing a notebook for you to fill, and the review template.\n\n7.1.5 Feedback on the process\nWe encourage you to ask questions and provide feedback on the review process on our forum."

Examples:\n\nYou know of an overlapping package, that hasn’t been mentioned in the process yet.\nYou see a question to which you have an expert answer that hasn’t been given after a few days (e.g. you know of a blog post tackling how to add images to package docs).\nConcerns related to e.g. the speed of the process should be tackled by the editor-in-chief so that’s who you’d turn to for such questions."

This will also add tag 1/editor-checks to the issue.\nSubmission will automatically generate package check output from ropensci-review-bot which should be examined for any outstanding issues (most exceptions will need to be justified by the author in the particular context of their package.). If you want to re-run checks after any package change post a comment @ropensci-review-bot check package.\nAfter automatic checks are posted, use the editor template to guide initial checks and record your response to the submission. You can also streamline your editor checks by using the pkgreviewr package created by associate editor Anna Krystalli. Please strive to finish the checks and start looking for reviewers within 5 working days.\nCheck that template has been properly filled out.\nCheck against policies for fit and overlap. Initiate discussion via Slack #software-review channel if needed for edge cases that haven’t been caught by previous checks by the EiC. If reject, see this section about how to respond.\nCheck that mandatory parts of template are complete. If not, direct authors toward appropriate instructions.\nFor packages needing continuous integration on multiple platforms (cf criteria in this section of the CI chapter) make sure the package gets tested on multiple platforms (having the package built on several operating systems via GitHub Actions for instance).\nWherever possible when asking for changes, direct authors to automatic tools such as usethis and styler, and to online resources (sections of this guide, sections of the R packages book) to make your feedback easier to use. Example of editor’s checks.\nIdeally, the remarks you make should be tackled before reviewers start reviewing.\nIf initial checks show major gaps, request changes before assigning reviewers. If the author mentions changes might take time, apply the holding label via typing @ropensci-review-bot put on hold. You’ll get a reminder every 90 days (in the issue) to check in with the package author(s).\nIf the package raises a new issue for rOpenSci policy, start a conversation in Slack or open a discussion on the rOpenSci forum to discuss it with other editors (example of policy discussion).\n\n8.2.2 Look for and assign two reviewers:\n\n8.2.2.1 Tasks\n\nComment with @ropensci-review-bot seeking reviewers.\nUse the email template if needed for inviting reviewers\n\nWhen inviting reviewers, include something like “if I don’t hear from you in a week, I’ll assume you are unable to review,” so as to give a clear deadline when you’ll move on to looking for someone else.\n\n\nAssign reviewers with @ropensci-review-bot assign @username as reviewer. add can also be used instead of assign, and to reviewers (plural) instead of as reviewer (single). The following is thus also valid: @ropensci-review-bot add @username to reviewers. One command should be issued for each reviewer. If needed later, remove reviewers with @ropensci-review-bot remove @username from reviewers.\nIf you want to change the due date for a review use @ropensci-review-bot set due date for @username to YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n8.2.2.2 How to look for reviewers\n\n8.2.2.2.1 Where to look for reviewers?\nAs a (guest) editor, use\n\nthe potential suggestions made by the submitter(s), (although submitters may have a narrow view of the types of expertise needed. We suggest not using more than one of suggested reviewers);\nthe Airtable database of reviewers and volunteers (see next subsection);\nand the authors of rOpenSci packages.\n\nWhen these sources of information are not enough,\n\nping other editors in Slack for ideas,\nlook for users of the package or of the data source/upstream service the package connects to (via their opening issues in the repository, starring it, citing it in papers, talking about it on Twitter).\nYou can also search for authors of related packages on r-pkg.org.\nR-Ladies has a directory specifying skills and interests of people listed.\nYou might tweet about the reviewer search.\n\n8.2.2.2.2 Tips for reviewer search in Airtable\nYour tools for searching reviewers in the Airtable are\n\nfilters (please remove them once you’re done), see example below.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Airtable filters interface with a filter on domain expertise that has to include chemistry and technical areas that have to include continuous integration\n\n\n\ncreating a duplicated view, depending on your Airtable skills.\n\nHave a look at the last_time_contacted and last_answer columns before contacting someone! If someone recently refused because they were busy, it might be best to abstain, whereas someone who refused because of a COI could be contacted again without waiting too long.\n\n8.2.2.2.3 Storing information from the reviewer search in Airtable\nFor people listed in the Airtable, if you contact them about a review please update the last_time_contacted column, and enter the category corresponding to their answer in last_answer.\nOnly add people to Airtable if they accept to review (otherwise, people should volunteer themselves by filling the Airtable form). Do not enter any information other than GitHub username, name and email address yourself. Point reviewers to the Airtable form.\n\n8.2.2.2.4 Criteria for choosing a reviewer\nHere are criteria to keep in mind when choosing a reviewer. You might need to piece this information together by searching CRAN and the potential reviewer’s GitHub page and general online presence (personal website, Twitter).\n\nHas not reviewed a package for us within the last 6 months.\nSome package development experience.\nSome domain experience in the field of the package or data source\nNo conflicts of interest.\nTry to balance your sense of the potential reviewer’s experience against the complexity of the package.\nDiversity - with two reviewers both shouldn’t be cis white males.\nSome evidence that they are interested in openness or R community activities, although blind emailing is fine.\n\nEach submission should be reviewed by two package reviewers. Although it is fine for one of them to have less package development experience and more domain knowledge, the review should not be split in two. Both reviewers need to review the package comprehensively, though from their particular perspective. In general, at least one reviewer should have prior reviewing experience, and of course inviting one new reviewer expands our pool of reviewers.\n\n8.2.3 During review:\n\nCheck in with reviewers and authors occasionally. Offer clarification and help as needed.\nIn general aim for 3 weeks for review, 2 weeks for subsequent changes, and 1 week for reviewer approval of changes.\nUpon each review being submitted,\n\nWrite a comment thanking the reviewer with your words;\nRecord the review via typing a new comment @ropensci-review-bot submit review <review-url> time <time in hours>. E.g. for the review https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/329#issuecomment-809783937 the comment would be @ropensci-review-bot submit review https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/329#issuecomment-809783937 time 4.\n\n\nIf the author stops responding, refer to the policies and/or ping the other editors in the Slack channel for discussion. Importantly, if a reviewer was assigned to a closed issue, contact them when closing the issue to explain the decision, thank them once again for their work, and make a note in our database to assign them to a submission with high chances of smooth software review next time (e.g. a package author who has already submitted packages to us).\nUpon changes being made, change the review status tag to 5/awaiting-reviewer-response, and request that reviewers indicate approval with the reviewer approval template.\n\n8.2.4 After review:\n\n@ropensci-review-bot approve <package-name>\nIf the original repository owner opposes transfer, add a line with its address to this repos list to ensure the package gets included in rOpenSci package registry.\nNominate a package to be featured in an rOpenSci blog post or tech note if you think it might be of high interest. Please note in the software review issue one or two things the author could highlight, and tag @ropensci/blog-editors for follow-up.\nIf authors maintain a gitbook that is at least partly about their package, contact an rOpenSci staff member so they might contact the authors about transfer to the ropensci-books GitHub organisation.\n\n8.2.5 Package promotion:\n\nDirect the author to the chapters of the guide about package releases, marketing and GitHub grooming."

Mostly this just rotates among editors, unless the EiC thinks an editor is particularly suited to a package, or an editor declines handling the submission due to being too busy or because of conflicting interests.\n@ropensci-review-bot assign @username as editor\n\nMonitors pace of review process and reminds other editors to move packages along as needed.\nOn assuming EiC rotation, reviews status of current open reviews and reminds editors to respond or update status as needed.\nResponds to issues posted to the software-review-meta repo\n\nMakes decisions on scope/overlap for pre-submission inquiries, referrals from JOSS or other publication partners, and submissions if they see an ambiguous case (This last case may also be done by handling editors (see below)). To initiate discussion, this is posted to the rOpenSci Slack editors-only channel along with a small summary of what the (pre-)submitted/referred submission is about, what doubts the EiC has i.e. digesting information a bit. If after one day or two the EiC feels they haven’t received enough answers, they can ping all editors.\n\nAny editor should feel free to step in on these. See this section about how to respond to out-of-scope (pre-) submissions.\nAfter explaining the out-of-scope decision, write an issue comment @ropensci-review-bot out-of-scope.\n\n\nRequests a new EiC when their rotation is up (set a calendar reminder ahead of your expected end date and ask for volunteers in the editors’ Slack channel)\n\n\n8.3.1 Asking for more details\nIn some cases online documentation is sparse. Minimal README, no pkgdown website make assessment harder. In that case please ask for more details: even if the package is deemed out-of-scope, the package docs will have gotten better so we are fine asking for these efforts.\nExample text\nHello <username> and many thanks for your submission.\n\nWe are discussing whether the package is in scope and need a bit more information.\n\nWould you mind adding more details and context to the README?\nAfter reading it someone with little domain knowledge should have been informed about the aim, goals and functionality of the package.\n\n<optional>\nIf a package has overlapping functionality with other packages, we require it to demonstrate in the documentation [how it is best in class](https://devguide.ropensci.org/policies.html#overlap). Could you add a more detailed comparison to the packages you mention in the README so we can evaluate?\n</optional>\n\n8.3.2 Inviting a guest editor\nAfter discussion with other editors the EiC might invite a guest editor to handle a submission (e.g. if submission volume is large, if all editors have a conflict of interest, if specific expertise is needed, or as a trial prior to inviting a person to join the editorial board).\nWhen inviting a guest editor,\n\nAsk about conflicts of interest using the same phrasing as for reviewers,\nGive a link to the guide for editors.\n\nIf the person said yes (yay!),\n\nMake sure they enabled 2FA for their GitHub account,\nInvite them to the ropensci/editors team and to the ropensci organization,\nOnce they’ve accepted this repo invitation, assign the issue to them,\nEnsure they’re (already) invited to rOpenSci Slack workspace,\nAdd their name to the Airtable guest-editor table (so their names might appear in this book and in the software-review README).\n\nAfter the review process is finished (package approved, issue closed),\n\nThank the guest editor again,\nRemove them from the ropensci/editors team (but not from the ropensci organization)."

For larger amendments, request review from at least a few editors (if none participated in the discussion related to the amendment, request a review from all of them on GitHub, and in the absence of any reaction merge after a week).\nTwo weeks before a dev guide release, once the PR from dev to master and the release blog post are ready for review, all editors should be pinged by GitHub (“review request” on the PR from dev to master) and Slack, but the release doesn’t need all of them to explicitly approve the release.\n\n8.6.2 Blog post about a release\nThe blog post about a release will be reviewed by editors, and one of @ropensci/blog-editors.\n\n8.6.2.1 Content\nRefer to the general rOpenSci blogging guidance, and the more specific guidance below.\nFirst example of such a post; second example.\nThe blog post should mention all important items from the changelog organized in (sub)sections: e.g. a section about big change A, another one about big change B, and one about smaller changes lumped together.

Please add this text to the README\nPlease note that this package is released with a [Contributor\nCode of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/). \nBy\ncontributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.\nAnd delete the package current code of conduct if there was one.\n\n10.1.2 Contributing guide\nYou can use issue, pull request and contributing guidelines. Having a contributing file as .github/CONTRIBUTING.md or docs/CONTRIBUTING.md is compulsory. An easy way to insert a template for a contributing guide is the use_tidy_contributing() function from the usethis package, which inserts this template as .github/CONTRIBUTING.md. A more extensive example is this template by Peter Desmet, or the comprehensive GitHub wiki pages for the mlr3 package. These and other templates will generally need to be modified for use with an rOpenSci package, particularly by referring and linking to our Code of Conduct, as described elsewhere in this book. Modifying a generic contributing guide to add a personal touch also tends to make it look less generic and more sincere. Personal preferences in a contributing guide include:\n\nStyle preferences? You might however prefer to make style a configuration (of lintr, styler) or to fix code style yourself especially if you don’t use a popular code style like the tidyverse coding style.\nInfrastructure like roxygen2?\nWorkflow preferences? Issue before a PR?\nA scope statement, like in the skimr package?\nSandbox account creation? Mocking in tests? Linking to external docs?\n\nrOpenSci further encourages contributing guides to include a lifecycle statement clarifying visions and expectations for the future development of your package, like in this example. Statistical packages are required to have a lifecycle statement, as specified in General Statistical Stanards G1.2. That links provides a template for a simple lifecycle statement. CONTRIBUTING.md files can also describe how you acknowledge contributions (see this section).\nWe encourage you to direct feedback that is not a bug report or a feature request to rOpenSci forum, after making sure you’d see such questions on the forum. Users can use the forum to ask questions about use and report their use cases, and you can subscribe to individual categories and tags to receive notifications about your package. Feel free to mention this in the docs of your package and/or the contributing guidelines/issue template. Please direct your users to tag posts with the package name.\nOnce a pull request is closer to being merged, you could use a GitHub Actions PR workflow to style the code with styler.\n\n10.1.3 Issue management\nBy using GitHub features around issues you can help potential contributors find them, and make your roadmap public.\n\n10.1.3.1 Issue labelling\nYou can use labels such as “help wanted” and “good first issue” to help potential collaborators, including newbies, find your repo. Cf GitHub article. You can also use the “Beginner” label. See examples of beginner issues over all ropensci repos.\n\n10.1.3.2 Pinning issues\nYou can pin up to 3 issues by repository that will then appear at the top of your issue tracker as nice issue cards. It can help advertise what your priorities are.\n\n10.1.3.3 Milestones\nYou can create milestones and assign issues to them, which help see what you plan for the next version of your package for instance."

You should increase their rights to the repo as you gain trust, and you should definitely acknowledge contributions (see this section).\nYou can ask a new collaborator to make PRs (see following section for assessing a PR locally, i.e. beyond CI checks) to dev/main and assess them before merging, and after a while let them push to main, although you might want to keep a system of PR reviews… even for yourself once you have team mates!\nA possible model for onboarding collaborators is provided by Jim Hester in his lintr repo.\nIf your problem is recruiting collaborators, you can post an open call like Jim Hester’s on Twitter, GitHub, and as an rOpenSci package author, you can ask for help in rOpenSci slack and ask rOpenSci team for ideas for recruiting new collaborators.\n\n10.2.2 Working with collaborators (including yourself)\nBranches are cheap. Use them extensively when developing features, testing out new ideas, fixing problems.\nOne of the branches is the default / main branch, where, if you follow trunk-based development, you “merge small, frequent updates”. See also GitHub flow and GitLab flow docs. You might want to pair the frequent incrementing of version numbers (in DESCRIPTION). One particular aspect of working with collaborators is reviewing pull requests, with some useful guidance in:\n\nThe Art of Giving and Receiving Code Reviews (Gracefully), by Alex Hill\nGitHub documentation about PR reviews\n\nFor making and reviewing pull requests we recommend exploring usethis functions.\n\n10.2.3 Be generous with attributions\nIf someone contributes to your repository consider adding them in DESCRIPTION, as contributor (“ctb”) for small contributions, author (“aut”) for bigger contributions. Traditionally when citing a package in a scientific publication only “aut” authors are listed, not “ctb” contributors; and on pkgdown websites only “aut” names are listed on the homepage, all authors being listed on the authors/ page.\nAt a minimum consider adding the name of contributors near the feature/bug fix line in NEWS.md.\nWe recommend your being generous with such acknowledgements, because it is a nice thing to do and because it will make folks more likely to contribute again to your package or other repos of the organization.\nAs a reminder from our packaging guidelines if your package was reviewed and you feel that your reviewers have made a substantial contribution to the development of your package, you may list them in the Authors@R field with a Reviewer contributor type (\"rev\"), like so:\n    person(\"Bea\", \"Hernández\", role = \"rev\",\n    comment = \"Bea reviewed the package (v. X.X.XX) for rOpenSci, see <https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/116>\"),\nOnly include reviewers after asking for their consent. Read more in this blog post “Thanking Your Reviewers: Gratitude through Semantic Metadata”. Note that ‘rev’ will raise a CRAN NOTE unless the package is built using R v3.5. Make sure you use roxygen2’s latest CRAN version.\nPlease do not list editors as contributors. Your participation in and contribution to rOpenSci is thanks enough!\n\n10.2.4 Welcoming collaborators to rOpenSci\nIf you give someone write permissions to the repository,\n\nplease contact a staff member so that this new contributor might get invited to rOpenSci’s “ropensci” GitHub organization (instead of being an outside collaborator)\nplease contact rOpenSci’s community manager or another staff member so that this new contributor might get get invited to rOpenSci Slack workspace."

In these cases do get in touch with us so we can offer any help as needed.\nIf the package has not been archived by CRAN and there is a maintainer change, have the old maintainer email CRAN and put in writing who the new maintainer is. Make sure to mention that email about the maintainer change when you submit the first new version to CRAN. If the old maintainer is unreachable or will not send this email get in touch with rOpenSci staff.\nIf the previous maintainer is reachable, scheduling a meeting will help you get the “lay of the land”\n\n\n11.3.1 FAQ for new maintainers\n\n\nThere are a few unresolved issues from the package that I don’t know how to fix. Whom may I ask for help?\nIt depends; here’s what to do in different scenarios:\n\nif the old maintainer can be contacted: reach out to them, and ask for help;\nrOpenSci slack: good for getting help on specific or general problems, see the #package-maintenance channel;\n\nrOpenSci discussion forum: this forum is a good option, feel free to ask any questions there;\n\nrOpenSci staff: feel free to get in touch with one of us via email/pinging us on GitHub issues, we’ll be happy to help;\nof course there’s general R help too if that suits your needs: RStudio community forum, StackOverflow, Twitter #rstats, etc.\n\n\n\nHow much can/should you change in the package?\nFor general help on changing code in a package, see the Package evolution section.\nWhen thinking though this, there are many considerations.\nHow much time do you have to spend on the package? If you have very limited time, it’d be best to focus on the most critical tasks, whatever those are for the package in question. If you have ample amount of time, your goals can be larger in scope.\nHow mature is the package? If the package is mature, many people likely have code that depends on the package’s API (i.e., the exported functions, and their parameters). In addition, if there are packages that depend on your package on CRAN, then you need to check that whatever changes you make don’t break those packages. The more mature the package is, the more careful you need to be about making changes, especially with the names of exported functions, their parameters, and the exact structure of what exported functions return. Changes can be more easily made that only affect internals of the package."

You must add one for your package, and make it easy to read.\n\nIt is mandatory to use a NEWS or NEWS.md file in the root of your package. We recommend using NEWS.md to make the file more browsable.\nPlease use our example NEWS file as a model. You can find a good NEWS file in the wild in the taxize package repo for instance.\nIf you use NEWS, add it to .Rbuildignore, but not if you use NEWS.md\n\nUpdate the news file before every CRAN release, with a section with the package name, version and date of release, like (as seen in our example NEWS file):\n\nfoobar 0.2.0 (2016-04-01)\n=========================\n\nUnder that header, put in sections as needed, including: NEW FEATURES, MINOR IMPROVEMENTS, BUG FIXES, DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT, DOCUMENTATION FIXES and any special heading grouping a large number of changes. Under each header, list items as needed (as seen in our example NEWS file). For each item give a description of the new feature, improvement, bug fix, or deprecated function/feature. Link to any related GitHub issue like (#12). The (#12) will resolve on GitHub in Releases to a link to that issue in the repo.\nAfter you have added a git tag and pushed up to GitHub, add the news items for that tagged version to the Release notes of a release in your GitHub repo with a title like pkgname v0.1.0. See GitHub docs about creating a release.\nNew CRAN releases will be tweeted about automatically by roknowtifier and written about in our biweekly newsletter but see next chapter about marketing about how to inform more potential users about the release.\nFor more guidance about the NEWS file we suggest reading the tidyverse NEWS style guide."

Some packages containing a lot of C++ code might get classified as C++ rather than R packages, which is fine and shows the need for the “r”, “r-package” and “rstats” topics.\nWe recommend overriding GitHub linguist by adding or modifying a .gitattributes to your repo in two cases:\n\nIf you store html files in non standard places (not in docs/, e.g. in vignettes/) use the documentation overrides. Add *.html linguist-documentation=true to .gitattributes (Example in the wild)\nIf your repo contains code you haven’t authored, e.g. JavaScript code, add inst/js/* linguist-vendored to .gitattributes (Example in the wild)\n\nThis way the language classification and statistics of your repository will more closely reflect the source code it contains, as well as making it more discoverable. Notably, if linguist does not correctly recognize your repo as containing mainly R code, your package won’t appear in search results with the language:R filter. Similarly, your repo cannot be listed among the trending R repos.\nMore info about GitHub linguist overrides here."

Add any functions to this page as needed, and take away as a function moves to defunct (see below).\n\nIn the next version (v0.3.0) you can make the function defunct (that is, completely gone from the package, except for a man page with a note about it).\n\nIn the function itself, use .Defunct() like:\nfoo <- function() {\n    .Defunct(\"bar\")\n}\nNote that the message in .Defunct is an error so that the function stops whereas .Deprecated uses a warning that let the function proceed.\nIn addition, it’s good to add ... to all defunct functions so that if users pass in any parameters they’ll get the same defunct message instead of a unused argument message, so like:\nfoo <- function(...) {\n    .Defunct(\"bar\")\n}\nWithout ... gives:\nfoo(x = 5)\n#> Error in foo(x = 5) : unused argument (x = 5)\nAnd with ... gives:\nfoo(x = 5)\n#> Error: 'foo' has been removed from this package\nMake a man page for defunct functions like:\n#' Defunct functions in helloworld\n#' \n#' These functions are gone, no longer available.\n#' \n#' \\itemize{\n#'  \\item \\code{\\link{foo}}: This function is defunct.\n#' }\n#' \n#' @name helloworld-defunct\nNULL\nThis creates a man page that users can access like ?`helloworld-defunct` and they’ll see in the documentation index. Add any functions to this page as needed. You’ll likely want to keep this man page indefinitely.\n\n15.5.1 Testing deprecated functions\nYou don’t have to change the tests of deprecated functions until they are made defunct.\n\nConsider any changes made to a deprecated function. Along with using .Deprecated inside the function, did you change the parameters at all in the deprecated function, or create a new function that replaces the deprecated function, etc. Those changes should be tested if any made.\nRelated to above, if the deprecated function is simply getting a name change, perhaps test that the old and new functions return identical results.\n\nsuppressWarnings() could be used to suppress the warning thrown from .Deprecated, but tests are not user facing, so it is not that bad if the warning is thrown in tests, and the warning could even be used as a reminder to the maintainer.\n\nOnce a function is made defunct, its tests are simply removed."

Encourage PRs, have them reviewed.\n\n### 1 month prior to release\n\n- [ ] Remind editors to open issues/PRs for items they want to see in the next version.\n\n- [ ] Run [the `devguide_prerelease()` function](https://github.com/ropensci-org/devguider) from the `devguider` package.\n\n- [ ] Ask editors for any feedback you need from them before release.\n\n- [ ] For each contribution/change make sure the NEWS in Appendix.Rmd were updated.\n\n- [ ] Plan a date for release in communication with rOpenSci's Community Manager who will give you a date for publishing a blog post / tech note.\n\n### 2 weeks prior to release\n\n- [ ] Draft a blog post / tech note about the release with enough advance for editors and then Community Manager to review it (2 weeks). [Example](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/pull/291), [General blog post instructions](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2#contributing-a-blog-post), [specific instructions for release posts](#releaseblogpost). \n\n- [ ] Make a PR from the dev branch to the master branch, ping editors on GitHub and Slack. Mention the blog post draft in a comment on this PR.\n\n### Release\n\n- [ ] Check URLs using [the `devguide_urls()` function from the {devguider} package](https://github.com/ropensci-org/devguider)\n\n- [ ] Check spelling using [the `devguide_spelling()` function from the {devguider} package](https://github.com/ropensci-org/devguider). Update the [WORDLIST](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide/blob/master/inst/WORDLIST) as necessary.\n\n- [ ] Squash and merge the PR from dev to master.\n\n- [ ] GitHub release, check Zenodo release.\n\n- [ ] Re-build (for Zenodo metadata update in the book) or wait for daily build\n\n- [ ] Re-create the dev branch\n\n- [ ] Finish your blog post / tech note PR. Underline the most important aspects to be highlighted in tweets as part of the PR discussion."
